# Genshinfo

## Idea
The idea is to create a website that helps your average genshin player.
For example by looking up all kinds of information about characters, elements, etc. or by calculating the amount of primogems needed until they're guaranteed to get their next 5* and much more. 

## Features
I just started this project so the only features are:
- Displaying elements on homepage via API
- Converting primogems to fates

## Planned
- Using the (fan made) [Genshin API](https://genshin.dev) to fetch and display all kinds of data
- Creating a site that calculates how many primogems are needed to get their guaranteed next 5*
- Creating a site that calculates the chance of their next character being a 5*
- Creating a site that calculates the damage a character can do by combining base atk with crit dmg, elemental dmg bonus and so on.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jynxwk/Genshinfo.git
